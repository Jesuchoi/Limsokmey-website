        <p>Firstly, Lee Jong Suk has a unique and distinctive appearance that sets him apart from other actors. His tall and lean physique, combined with his sharp facial features and intense gaze, make him stand out on screen.

            Secondly, Lee Jong Suk has starred in several popular K-dramas, such as "Pinocchio," "While You Were Sleeping," and "W." These dramas have been well-received by audiences and have helped to increase his popularity.
            
            Thirdly, Lee Jong Suk has a large and dedicated fanbase that supports him and follows his career closely. He is also known for his friendly and approachable personality, which has endeared him to fans.
            
            Popularity is subjective, and what I may consider good acting, another person may not. Different actors have their own unique styles and strengths. Ultimately, it is up to us to decide which actors we enjoy watching and appreciate.</p>
