        <p>I am very foodie. I love to eat and cook. The food gives us energy. Without food, there is no life.</p>
        <p>There are so many dishes available in today's world some like Asians food,some like western foods.<br>1. I like Amok(អាមុក), It is a national dish, made from fish, coconut milk and curry paste.<br>

            2. Num banhchok samlor Khmer (នំបញ្ចុកសម្លខ្មែរ) with a base made out of green kroeung with pounded fish and varying amount of lemongrass with or without the addition of coconut milk. It is served with a peanut-based relish. </p>
