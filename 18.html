        <p>When I study at Hunsen balang High school in grade 10 to grade 12. I am a youth volunteers of 
            Cambodia Red Cross. Starting work for the first time, I learned about firefighting from experts to help people in trouble.<br>
            After that, I went to inspect the houses of the villagers and launched a campaign to apply Abet to kill worms, eradicate tiger mosquitoes to reduce and eradicate dengue fever.<br>
            Sometimes we run a campaign to clean up the city by picking up trash on the streets.<br>
            And we did a lot of volunteer work and learned a lot from this job.</p>
